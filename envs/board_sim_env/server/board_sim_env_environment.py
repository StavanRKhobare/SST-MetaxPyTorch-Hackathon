"""NeuralEdge AI Boardroom — OpenEnv environment.

The agent plays the CEO of a Series B AI startup. Each of 10 rounds it sees
a market-crisis event, statements + votes from 4 hidden-agenda NPC board
members, and must pick one of 3 decisions. Decisions are resolved by a
weighted vote and produce dense reward proportional to a composite
profitability score plus coalition / trust shaping terms.

NPCs are deterministic-given-(seed, round, state) — same observation in
training and resolution — so GRPO has a stable target to learn against.
